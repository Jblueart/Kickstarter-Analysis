# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

An in depth look at kickstarter campaigns with varrying levels of success to determine a plan to optimize our chances of success with future campaigns. 

### Purpose

To understand the variety of projects and outcomes that then lead to success.

## Analysis and Challenges

Sorry this is a bit short, I thought it was due on Saturday the 14th for some reason. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 
Many of the more modest goals, were the more successful campaigns and they were able to get more than they initially requested. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

It's so much data to sift thru that It's hard to look at the cyclical nature of the quarterly outcomes and see larger paterns. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Both Q1 & Q2 tend to have more contributers and larger donations. More projects were canceled in Q3 & Q4, especially in 2017. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Documentaries tended to have greater success towards their goals vs Gadgets & wearables which both had loftier goals and were more likely to fail or be canceled. 
	It also looks as if successful projects tended to garner approximately 60% or more of their goal funding, 
so that while the kickstarter creators may have enjoyed higher ambitions then they were able to acheive, they still were able to create successful projects. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Only covers years 2013-2017. Doesn't show client satisfaction with the projects to show which projects were most enjoyed after production. 
I would love to get an idea of how many people interacted with a project aside from just backers. For instance, which projects had professional staff vs volunteers as well as audience reach. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


I charted the sum of goals vs pledges and grouped the projects by success to create a wide view of the information. 
We could also look at topics within the categories and chart the average donation to get an idea of reasonable goals for the projects.
